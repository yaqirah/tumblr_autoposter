# Tumblr Autoposter
This is bot that posts to a specified blog when run. Posts are tagged and found based off of file names. After being put together, posts are put into queue to stagger the times said posts are published. This allows the blog to keep a daily schedule and allow posts to be reviewed in advance.

The bot was originally made to help manage the blog [Daily Koichi](http://daily-koichi.tumblr.com) after there were complaints that the name of the blog was a lie.
